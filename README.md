# WhiteBloodCells_Classification
Project(2022)

# SCOPE
White blood cells (WBCs) play a significant role in the human immune system, and the content 
of various subtypes of WBCs is usually maintained within a certain range in the human body, 
while deviant levels are important warning signs for diseases. Hence, the detection and 
classification of WBCs is an essential diagnostic technique. However, traditional WBC 
classification technologies based on image processing usually need to segment the collected 
target cell images from the background. This pre-processing operation not only increases the 
workload but also heavily affects the classification quality and efficiency. Therefore, we 
proposed one high-efficiency object detection technology that combines the segmentation and 
recognition of targets into one step to realize the detection and classification of WBCs in an 
image at the same time. Two state-of-the-art object detection models, Faster RCNN and 
Yolov4, were employed and comparatively studied to classify neutrophils, eosinophils, 
monocytes, and lymphocytes on a balanced and enhanced Blood Cell Count Dataset (BCCD)
